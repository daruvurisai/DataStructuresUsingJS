Objectives:-
1)Define what an algorithm is?
2)Devise a plan to solve algorithm
3)Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequncy counters , two pointer problems and divide and conquer.

1)what is an algorithm?
A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task.

2)How do we Improve?
-->Devise a plan for solving problem.
-->Master common problem solving patterns

3)Problem solving patterns
-->Undestand the problem
-->explore concrete examples
-->Break it down
-->Solve/Simplify
-->Look back and refactor

4)Understanding the problem
-->Can i restate the problemin my own words
-->what are the inputs that go into the problem
-->What are the outputs that shoud come from the solution to the problem
-->Can be outputs be determined from the inputs?In other words do i have the ebough informatiion to solve the problem?
-->How shoud i label the important pieces of data that are part of a problem.
